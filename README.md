# Compose Files

Enables standing up a local test database and backend with a single compose command, i.e. `docker compose up` Front end should be started from its own repo with `npm run serve`.

This works well in conjunction with the script in the "Test Scripts" repo to quickly perform end to end tests to verify changes on the developer's machine.
